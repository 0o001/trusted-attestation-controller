# KMRA-plugin

Intel(R) KMRA (Key Management Reference Application) provides
reference implementation for a KeyManager interface.
It requires running host with `appHSM` server from KMRA project:
https://01.org/key-management-reference-application-kmra
The server provides REST API management interface secured
with mutual TLS.
The secure connection requires CA and SSL certificates to be
available for kmStore.

The client certificate and key can be obtained from host running
appHSM service. By default, they are located in `/opt/intel/ca`
directory. They can be copied using ssh access (e.g. scp).
Please ask host admin for access or KMRA team to provide the files.

Copy the key and certificate to the host with sgx attestation controller.
The below target location of files is an example.

kmra_host:/opt/intel/ca/ctk_loadkey.key -> /ca/ctk_loadkey.key
kmra_host:/opt/intel/ca/ctk_loadkey.crt -> /ca/ctk_loadkey.crt
kmra_host:/opt/intel/ca/ca.crt          -> /ca/ca.crt

Use the correct data to create and configure kmStore instance.

config := &kmstore.Config{
    ClientCert: "/ca/ctk_loadkey.crt",
    ClientKey:  "/ca/ctk_loadkey.key",
    CaCert:     "/ca/ca.crt",
    KMHost:     "kmra_host:5000",
}
kmra := kmstore.NewKmStore(config)

NOTE: The minimum required version of appHSM REST API is 0.2.
It is verified during initialization of kmStore instance.

# Setting up the key server

[Download the KMRA v2.0](https://01.org/key-management-reference-application-kmra/downloads/key-management-reference-application-kmra-v2.0) source code and refer to its instructions
for setting up the key server on a host that is securely accessible from your Kubernetes cluster.

# Plugin configuration

While deploying the `trusted-attestation-controller` with KMRA plugin,
update the configuration with the AppHSM server URL and the TLS
certificates information:

If your are deploying from source:

```sh
export SERVER_URL=<<https://server-address:port>>
sed -ie "s;^KEY_SERVER=\(.*\);$SERVER_URL;g" ./config/plugins/kmra/.key-server.conf
sed -e "s;^\(ca.crt=\).*;\1$(base64 -w 0 /ca/certificate/file);g" \
     -e "s;^\(client.crt=\).*;\1$(base64 -w 0 /client/certificate/file);g" \
     -e "s;^\(client.key=\).*;\1$(base64 -w 0 /client/privatekey/file);g" ./config/manager/.ca.secrets
```

Incase your are deploying with the pre-generated deployment:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intel/trusted-attestation-controller/main/deployment/tac-with-kmra.yaml -o tac.yaml

# Update the server URL and TLS certificates
sed -i 's/\(KEY_SERVER: \).*/\1 "'$SERVER_URL'")' tac.yaml
sed -e "s;^\(ca.crt: \).*;\1$(base64 -w 0 /ca/certificate/file);g" \
     -e "s;^\(client.crt: \).*;\1$(base64 -w 0 /client/certificate/file);g" \
     -e "s;^\(client.key: \).*;\1$(base64 -w 0 /client/privatekey/file);g" tac.yaml
```
